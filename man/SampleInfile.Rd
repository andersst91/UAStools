\format{A dataframe containg the preperation file used to design the CS17-G2FE experiment, which
contains 594 two row plots and 1188 observations.

We recommend have repeated Barcodes and Plot numbers if there are multirow plots (mrowplot>1) as
the plotshpcreatre function accounts for this redundance within the function.
